## About the project
**Smart Lock** is an ESP32â€”based IoT device that allows you to control the door lock via a Telegram bot, automatically open it for authorized Bluetooth devices and detect suspicious activity using a motion sensor.

Specifically, our project is a box that we made using laser cutting. It opens/closes using our pinene-based mechanical lock and a toothed rack printed on a 3D printer, controlled by a Micro Servo. The lock movement occurs when the device is identified based on BLE RSSI (activation occurs within a radius of 1 meter). An IR sensor also works in parallel, which reads the activity near the device. All interaction takes place through a specially designed Bot, which receives information (about movement, closing and opening the lock), as well as commands to switch to automatic (BLE)

## Task
Create an autonomous security system that:
- Managed via Telegram
- Integrates with the existing door system
- It works in two modes: manual and automatic
- Sends notifications about events in real time

## Solution
**Hardware**: 
- ESP32
- Servo motor
- Motion sensor

**Software part**:
- Telegram bot in Python
- REST API on Flask for event handling
- ESP32 with Wi-Fi/BLE support
